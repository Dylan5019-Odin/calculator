Made for the Odin project, this is a web page that allows the user to do simple calculation.  
The calculations will always be done in order from left to right.  
  
Project Specs can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator  
For the section of the spec involving: ""use that result (19) as the first number in your new calculation, along with the next operator (-).""  
I decided to not add the next opperator to the display because I think it looks better
